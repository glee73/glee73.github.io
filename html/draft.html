    <p><strong>Before I discovered CS</strong>, I was mostly drawn to advocacy and research. <br> A few things I was passionate about: </p>

    <div class="content-list">
      <ul>
        <li> Co-founding a nonprofit for poverty reduction </li>
        <li> Leading research on lead water pipe replacement </li>
        <li> Volunteering to send PPE to healthcare/social workers</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>But after I took my first couple of CS courses, I fell in love with
    <strong> coding and creating </strong> and how
    <strong> technology can really improve peopleâ€™s lives</strong>.</p>
