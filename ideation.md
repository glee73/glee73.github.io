  * Before I discovered CS, I was mostly drawn to advocacy and
    research. A few things I was passionate about:

    • Co-founding a nonprofit for poverty reduction
    • Leading research on lead water pipe replacement
    • Volunteering to send PPE to healthcare/social workers

    But after I took my first couple of CS courses, I fell in love with
    coding and creating and how technology can really improve
    people’s lives.

    Here are some things I’ve made so far:
* PROJECT-CARD
  * Clean water
  * PPE Scraper
  * etc
